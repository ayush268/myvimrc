# Myvimrc
Step by Step Customization

I have tried to explain everything as I did.

# How To Setup

 1. Copy the contents of vimrc.vim in your ~/.vimrc file.

 2. Set up Vundle 
    $ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

 3. Start vim and execute in normal mode
    :PluginInstall

Please suggest any improvements as I am also learning how to improve my .vimrc
